This is for the CS206 Project for group Arron and Loi [Exploring the Impact of Randomized Splitting Strategies on Delta Debugging]

This repo contains the python scripts that were created for the above project. The sanitize.py script is the toy function and includes a generated test input set. 

The specific ddmin algorithms are split into different scripts to allow for easier testing. 

Testing every ddmin iteration that we introduce can be done with test_sanitize.py which will call all of the different iterations. [python3 test_sanitize.py]

ddmin = Traditional DD
ddmin_random.py = Delta Debugging Algorithm with Random Split Points (RS-DD)
ddmin_hybrid = Hybrid Delta Debugging Algorithm with Random Split Points (Hybrid-DD)
ddmin_alt = Random Split with Transition to Traditional Delta Debugging (RS-TDD)
